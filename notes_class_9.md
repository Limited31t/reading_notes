Class 09 reading notes

Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is a procedure that tells you how the company explains their policies and procedures within the company to perform and complete certain tasks.
There are three types of documents that are usually in an SOP. The POLICY document should give you a broad overarching guidance. The SOP should have all the answers to any what needs to be done, when will it be done and why are we doing it this way.
Finally it should have a WORK INSTRUCTION that will answer how we are going to do the work step by step.There should be multiple work instructions for the different work procedures that get done by any employee of a company.
SOP are for the company to implement and enforce the policies and procedures for the ay a company is going to meet their mission and vision
A SOP needs to be very readable, easily consumable and needs to be written in a format that is read easily.
A flow chart needs to be drawn up showing the flow of activities from the first step to the last. 
There needs to be a brief opening giving a description of what this procedure will be for and should have what inputs, outputs, the expected results and then any involved roles.
When writing an SOP you should have 5 main principles included within. Keep it simple, The SOP must be portable where you can make changes if a procedure change, Flowcharts and or diagrams because they can tell a quick story of how the job will progress,Consistency because it needs to flow the same format type from start to finish and finally remember its about the employees reading to SOP because we are writing the SOP for them and if it doesn't work for them then really it isn't working at all.
