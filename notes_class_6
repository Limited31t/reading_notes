The Windows 10 Defender Security Center ia faster and easier place to view overall the health and security of your machine, the apps associated to this is located in the Start Menu for easy access.
This new tool has 5 sections for the user to scroll through to figure out what they are wanting to review.
The first section is Virus and Threat protection where you can launch a 3rd party AV protection app and also scan the results while the threat history would store here as well.

The second would be Device performance and health of the machine. Here it monitors the battery life,gives a view of the latest Windows updates and storage capacity.  
If there is anything that needs to be looked at you will get a notice of what's needing attention.
