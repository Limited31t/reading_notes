Veeam Backup Free Edition
Veeam v7 is the latest version of the free virtual box backup tool and some of the new features are as follows:
Veeamzip Backup,Veeam explorer for exchange, Veeam explorer for storage snapshots,Veeam explorer for share point, migration of VMware, file copy job, VM copy job, FastSCP editor, Native tape support, file level recovery from backup, whole VM recovery from backup, and VM file recovery from backup (VMX,VHD,VMDK).
However you could summarize  Veeam into just three categories like Veeamzip, powerful and flexible restore and quick migration (VMmare).
VeeamZip lets you create a backup of running VM machines and the nice part is you only have to select two things for it to do and they select  the VM you are needing to backup and where you want to back it up at.
You do need to keep a regular update schedule with your Veeamzip before you do a backup in case there have been updates and patches.
It is also good to archive your backups so you have a second place to backup from incase that it is needed.
You can restore to the same location or you can restore to a separate location with this application.
There is a free tool built into the application that is Veeam Explorer for Microsoft SharePoint for easy working with.
VeeamZip can handle multiple virtual disk inside one VM
