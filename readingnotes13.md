The concept of Virtualization
The concept of virtualization goes back to the 1960â€™s but was popularized by VMWare in 1999, it was cheap intel hardware that would allow a computer to virtualize any traditional computer through software encapsulation.
A good example of virtualization is Amazon AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) which is really an IaaS service that gives  virtual servers based on Xen Hypervisor.
This acts like a virtual machine that sits on top of the host machine.
The AMI brand is mainly responsible for creating ON DEMAND virtual machines within the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) wouldn't exist without virtualization which is right at the core of IaaS and EC2.
Amazon can run different types of virtual machines of different sizes on top their hardware 
Amazon uses these virtual capabilities heavy that is offered by Xen hypervisor and Amazon AMI.
A customer of these virtual services are controlled through a web interface  as well as manages the entire system through API.
The similar IaaS offerings the same such as Compute Engine from Google or Microsoft Azuire also with on-premise products such as Eucalyptus or Open Stack.
Cloud computing leverages virtualization technology to provide resources as a utility.
