Malware removal
If your computer starts to run slower or you have been seeing alot more popups then you may have some type of virus, spyware, nefarious entity even if you have a virus program.
If you start seeing anything out of the ordinary then you need to disconnect the pc from the internet  to shut down any personal information being leaked onto the net.
Then you can turn off the pc and then restart in the SAFE MODE where it will only run the bare minimum programs. If the malware is designed to start running at the time of start up then this may help stop it from running and hopefully you can locate and remove easier when they aren't in use or running.
In Windows 10 you can start up in the safe mode by pushing the windows key and the start button. Then you hold the shift key and click reboot then a menu then select troubleshoot and then advance options next click startup settings.
The next window pops up then click restart then the next next screen will appear however this may take a few minutes, When a page appears with some number you will need to pick the number four which is SAFE MODE.
If you start to notice that the pc is running faster than normal then you may have some malware infections on the pc just because we are in SAFE MODE that is only allowing the bare minimum programs to run and the malware will make a lot of runs which slows down the pc.
Now you need to delete any temporary files because this can speed up the virus scanning and then you can start a virus scan on the pc. To start the disk cleanup you can type disk clean up in the search bar and when DISK CLEANUP appears then click it.
It's now time to run the malware scanner and it will capture and remove most standard infections but may not get everything.
If you already have a virus scanner then it's time you get a new one because the one you have has let some slip by but remember that there are no programs that are 100% in removing viruses because there are so many different types and there are new ones being made every day.
There are two types of antivirus programs and the first is REAL TIME antivirus that runs all the time in the background while the machine is running and then there is a second that only runs when you actually open the program and tell it to run.
If you are going to install a ondemand scanner then at this time you will need to restart in normal mode then go to the internet and download one like Malwarebytes Anti-Malware then turn off and restart in SAFE MODE as done earlier.
If you can't get on the net then you can download onto a flash drive from another pc then load on the infected one via the USB port and the flash drive.
Now you can download and run the malware program.
You will start by running the setup file and now follow the wizard to install the program on the pc. When the program is running as if it's a paid version and in 14 days it will revert back into a free mode then you can disable after 2 weeks if you choose to.
When you start the program it does an update check to make sure that it has all the latest information needed to remove the most viruses possible. 
Once the scan is complete it will show the results and then you can click the REMOVE button to get the infections off the pc and now you will be prompted to restart your pc in order to complete the process.
If the malware couldn't be removed you may need to reload WINDOWS on the PC but before you reload Windows you will want to copy all your files onto external USB or a flash drive so you do lose all of your information.
You do a factory restore and this will take your whole pc back to the start when you first purchased it which means that any apps or programs you may have loaded will be removed and you will need to reinstall them.
Remember to keep your pc clean by keeping a real time virus running anytime the machine is in operation.
Once you have removed the viruses now is when you need to go and change all your online passwords and also check your banking accounts to make sure no unauthorized activity is going on there.
Also remember to perform regular system backup so you can have a starting place in case you have a prom with MALWARE.
